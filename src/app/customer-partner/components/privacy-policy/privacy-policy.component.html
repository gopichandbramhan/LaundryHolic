                <p class="text-left fw-light px-3 pt-2">When you use our website, we collect information and data which will be personal in nature to you and might be changed by you from time to time. This entire information collection exercise is done by us to provide you with a website experience which is smooth, personal, safe and customized to meet your specific requirements. We have built our website in a way which enables you to normally browse our website without sharing any personal information. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. Our endeavour is to only collect information which is absolutely required by us to ensure we are providing seamless and efficient services to you. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature on the website. In our efforts to provide you the best of services, we might track your behaviour and purchase patterns online, which we then further use to offer better services. The information that we collect may also be used to ascertain the users' demographics, areas of interests, purchase patterns and behavior to better understand, protect and serve our users.

We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the Website and you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a session. Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of the Website that are placed by third parties. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.

While you can browse some sections of our Website without being a registered member, certain activities (such as placing an order to avail any service or services) may not require registration. We do use your contact information to send you offers based on your previous orders and your interests.</p>
